There's two versions for the two different sensors used, that should be the only difference between the two projects. Check your specific bot to see which sensor you have. Also, in order to test the bots for functionality using the included python script, install python-serial (or python3-serial) and add yourself to the dialout group (usermod -aG dialout <login_id>). You will have to log out and log back in.
