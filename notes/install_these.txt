In order to get the baseline functionality of the bot spun up on your laptop 
four extra packages will be needed: nmap, ros-kinetic-image-view, ros-kinetic-image-common, 
and ros-kinetic-image-transport-plugins. To install: 

sudo apt install nmap ros-kinetic-image-view ros-kinetic-image-common ros-kinetic-image-transport-plugins

Nmap is used in the connection script, and the rest for camera stream things.

For OpenCV functionality the ROS CV bridge will be necessary:

sudo apt install ros-kinetic-cv-bridge
